Data were provided by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.

I would like to thank Levente Sipos and his advisor Szabolcs Torma for our collaboration on the "Connectome-based diffusion using graph neural networks for generating high fidelity synthetic fMRI data" Scientific Students’ Association Report. Their insight and work has been invaluable. I would like to thank Karz Gergely and Artillence Kft. for providing us access to their hardware and allowing us to do our experiments for the Scientific Students’ Association Report.

I would like to extend my immense gratitude to my advisor, dr. Luca Szegletes for the constant support and for trusting me even when I did not trust myself.
