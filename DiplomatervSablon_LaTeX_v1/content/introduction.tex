\section{Structure}

In the second chapter, I will be introducing machine learning and neural network concepts important to my work, with a special focus on graph neural networks, introducing their key components and grouping them by structure and function. In the second half of the chapter I introduce medical data, legal and ethical questions surrounding it, the types of medical imaging data and give a bit of background on brain fMRI data.

In the third chapter I will introduce the technical background of my work: the programming language, deep learning frameworks and libraries used and document the used versions. In the second half of the chapter I go into the technical parts of working with fMRI data. This includes the used data formats, preprocessing measures and the libraries necessary for these tasks.

In the fourth chapter, I detail the various use-cases of graph networks in fMRI processing that I worked on. For each section I will introduce the corresponding dataset and detail the approach and methodology used in an attempt to solve the problem. I present the results of this approach and the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment.

In the last chapter, I will be detailing possible ways to enhance the modelsâ€™ capabilities
and directions this research could be taken in the future and drawing final conclusions about my work.
